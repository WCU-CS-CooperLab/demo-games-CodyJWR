I wanted to update coin dash to be my own flavor or strange feverish goofiness. You still use arrow keys to move as in the textbook but a lot of things are different. First, I changed a lot of the smaller details, like tweaking the hitbox on the cactus.
Then, I gave a small outline to the score and time and title, and that's when I knew where to start. I knew I wanted to change the coins to be pictures of me (from when I was 16 which is crazy since I'm freshly 21). I had the idea in my head to create an incremental dificulty so I then added if statements to see what level you were on so that depending on the level a bigger range of cactus spawned. Somewhere in between I changed the sound effect for the coin sound effect to a pitched up bruh sound. 

After that I saw the cactus and thought that it'd be pretty cool to be in a desert since we're dodging cactus, which made me implement a background change after 5 levels (I would like to add more backgrounds and get more out there with them as the levels went up). From there I had the idea to implement the powerup used in the textbook knowing how I can twist it. So I added the powerup and then added the bad coin, where when you collect it you lose 10 seconds of time to contrast the powerup's 5 second boost. I had also thought it'd be a great thing to make the collision a little bit bigger than the image itself (cause I'm insane) and I also added the undertaker bell sound effect for when you collect the coin.

I would love to add a new powerup that'd be a magnet so the collision on me gets bigger and add a level counter similar to the waves in space rocks but be constantly in the top middle with the score and timer. Overall this was a neat experience doing something my own, but I think I could have made something greater.
